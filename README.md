# Computer_Vision
This is a Repo that contains the most important project for anyone who wants to learn computer vision. I created it myself during my learning journey in Computer Vision, and it's amazing.

### Here is what we will learn
1. All fundamentals of image & video processing using OpenCV
2. Key techniques: color spaces, thresholding, blurring, edge detection
3. Contour detection & shape recognition
4. Face and eye detection
5. Object tracking basics
6. Working with webcam video streams
